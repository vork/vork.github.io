Simple, low-cost screening tools are important in the identification of such products in low- and middle-income countries. In the present study, a smartphone-based imaging software was developed for the quantification of thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) analyses. A performance evaluation of this tool in the TLC analysis of 14 active pharmaceutical ingredients according to the procedures of the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF) Minilab was carried out, following international guidelines and assessing accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, range and robustness of the method. Relative standard deviations of 2.79% and 4.46% between individual measurements were observed in the assessments of repeatability and intermediate precision, respectively. Small deliberate variations of the conditions hardly affected the results. A locally producible wooden box was designed which ensures TLC photography under standardized conditions and shielding from ambient light. Photography and image analysis were carried out with a low-cost Android-based smartphone. The app allows to share TLC photos and quantification results using messaging apps, e-mail, cable or Bluetooth connections, or to upload them to a cloud.

This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. In such image collections in the wild, standard pose estimation techniques fail due to very few estimated correspondences across images.

The way illumination is represented varies drastically between the methods. Either the methods focus on single-point lights such as in Neural Reflectance Fields for Appearance Acquisition, it is assumed to be known (NeRV), it is extracted from a trained NeRF as an illumination map (NeRFactor), or it is represented as Spherical Gaussians (NeRD and PhySG). It is also worth pointing out that nearly all methods focus on a single illumination per scene, except NeRD.\nWhile NeRD enabled decomposition from multiple views under different illumination, SGs only allowed for rather diffuse illuminations. Inspired from Pre-integrated Lighting from real-time rendering, we transfer this concept to a neural network, which handles the integration and can represent illuminations from a manifold of natural illuminations.\nMethod The Neural-PIL architecture. In FIGURE 1 visualizes the Neural-PIL architecture, which is inspired by pi-GAN. As seen, the mapping networks are used on the embedding $z^l$, which describes the general content of the environment map and the roughness $b_r$, which defines how rough and therefore how blurry the environment should be.\nPre-integrated Lighting visualzed. Visually this can be seen in FIGURE 2. If the BRDF, shown on the left for each pair, becomes rougher, the illuminations from a larger area get integrated. The result is a blurrier environment map.\nAs a joint decomposition of illumination, shape, and appearance is a challenging, ill-posed task, we introduce priors to the BRDF and illumination. The illumination should only lie on a smooth manifold of natural illumination and the BRDF on possible materials. Here, we introduce a Smooth Manifold Auto-Encoder (SMAE).\nSmooth-Manifold-Auto-Encoder. Inspired by Berthelot et al. - Understanding and Improving Interpolation in Autoencoders via an Adversarial Regularizer, we introduce the interpolation in latent space during training, we further introduce three additional losses which further aid in a smooth manifold formation. The smoothness loss encourages a smooth gradient w.r.t. to the interpolation factor and therefore achieves a smooth interpolation between two points in the latent space. The cyclic loss enforces that the encoder and decoder perform the same step by re-encoding the decoded interpolated embeddings and ensuring the re-encoded latent vectors are the same as the initial ones. Lastly, we add a discriminator trained on the examples from the dataset as real ones and the interpolated ones as fake and try to fool it with our interpolated embeddings. With these three losses, a smooth latent space is formed, which allows for an easy introduction in our framework, where the corresponding networks are frozen, and only the latent space is optimized.\n","date":1634601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634601600,"objectID":"6add6d439d4627f4ea9c14675576eb6e","permalink":"https://markboss.me/publication/2021-neural-pil/","publishdate":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-neural-pil/","section":"publication","summary":"Decomposing a scene into its shape, reflectance and illumination is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics.

The object can be rotated, or the camera can turn around the object. The result is a neural volume with an explicit representation of the appearance and illumination in the form of the BRDF and Spherical Gaussian (SG) environment illumination.\nThe method is based on the general structure of NeRF. However, NeRF encodes the scene to an implicit BRDF representation where a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) is queried for outgoing view directions at every point. Extracting information from NeRF is therefore not easily done, and the inference time for novel views takes around 30 seconds. Also, NeRF is not capable of relighting an object under any illumination. By introducing physically-based representations for lighting and appearance, NeRD can relighting an object, and information can be extracted from the neural volume. After our extraction process, the result is a regular texture mesh that can be rendered in real-time. See our results where we provide a web-based interactive renderer.\nMethod Decomposing the scene requires that the integral over the hemisphere from the rendering equation is decomposed into its parts. Here, we use a simplified version without self-emittance. $$L_o(x,\\omega_o) = \\int_\\Omega L_i(x,\\omega_i) f_r(x,\\omega_i,\\omega_o) (\\omega_i \\cdot n) d\\omega_i$$ Here, $L_o$ is the outgoing radiance for a point $x$ in the direction $\\omega_o$. This radiance is calculated by integrating all influences over the hemisphere $\\Omega$, which are based on the incoming light $L_i$ for each direction $\\omega_i$. The surface behavior is expressed as the BRDF $f_r$, which describes how incoming light $\\omega_i$ is directed to the outgoing direction $\\omega_o$. Lastly, a cosine term is used $(\\omega_i \\cdot n)$, which reduces the received light based on the angle towards the light source.\nThe inverse of this integral is highly ambiguous, and we use several approximations to solve it. We do not use any interreflections or shadowing, which means that we do not compute the incoming radiance recursively. Additionally, our illumination is expressed as SG, which reduces a full continuous integral to - in our case - 24 evaluation of the environment SGs.\nSteps of the query process. In a) the volume is constructed by tracing rays from each camera into the scene. Then samples are placed along with the rays in b), and based on the density at each sampling point, additional samples are placed in c). The samples are then evaluated into a BRDF, which is re-rendered using the jointly optimized illumination in d). Inspired by NeRF the method uses two MLPs, which encode the each position in the volume $\\textbf{x} = (x,y,z)$ to a volume density $\\sigma$ and a color or BRDF parameters. Figure 1 shows an overview of this optimization process.\nResults Click the images for an interactive 3D visualization.

Besides the local precision, this loss formulation generates material texture maps which are globally more consistent. The network is set up as a generator network trained in an adversarial fashion to ensure that only plausible maps are produced.

An exact representation of a real-world surface allows for a higher degree of realism. Capturing or artistically creating these materials is a time-consuming process. We propose a method which utilizes an encoder-decoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract parameters for the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) automatically from a sparse sample set. This is done by implementing a differentiable renderer, which allows for a loss backpropagation of rendered images. This photometric loss is essential because defining a numerical BRDF distance metric is difficult. A second loss is added, which compares the parameters maps directly. Therefore, the statistical properties of the BRDF model are learned, which reduces artifacts in the predicted parameters. This dual loss principal improves the result of the network significantly. Opposed to previous means this method retrieves information of the whole surface as spatially varying BRDF (SVBRDF) parameters with a sufficiently high resolution for intended real-world usage. The capture process for materials only requires five known light positions with a fixed camera position. This reduces the scanning time drastically, and a material sample can be obtained in seconds with an automated system.","tags":["Material Acquisition","Machine Learning","Multi-Shot","Flat Surface","SVBRDF"],"title":"Deep Dual Loss BRDF Parameter Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Legal Disclosure Information in accordance with Section 5 TMG\nMark Boss\nBismarckstr. 114\n72072 Tübingen\nContact Information E-Mail: markboss@mailbox.org\nInternet address: markboss.me\nDisclaimer Accountability for content The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care.
