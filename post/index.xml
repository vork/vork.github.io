This time it is the big one: CVPR. The &lt;a href="https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/AcceptedPapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of accepted papers&lt;/a> is massive again, with 2359 papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is even more astounding is that the number of NeRF papers has grown significantly. I scanned the provisional program for potential NeRF titles and manually confirmed a relationship to the NeRF field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, writing a summary is an entirely different task. Frank Dellaert contacted me on Twitter about the CVPR post this year, and he gave me an idea to automate the entire summary using an LLM and creating slides for the posts. He even provided me access to his tools, research database, and a ChatGPT API key. Thank you so much - the idea worked wonders :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I built a small program: ARCHIVE: Ai assisted Research Conference Human-readable Instant surVEy. It automatically creates a summary (thanks, OpenAI 😅) and formats the blog posts below. As the blog post is rather long, I also extended the tool to auto-generate a &lt;a href="https://markboss.me/archive_presentations/cvpr23/">slide deck&lt;/a> which also showcases prominent figures from the papers (automatically extracted). The ESC key displays a slide overview and you can use the arrow keys to move through the presentation (Categories left/right, individual slides up/down). The slide title is also a link to the paper itself. The entire deck is automatically generated by the tool (including extracting images and figure descriptions).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am extending the tool to provide other use cases, but this will be left for another blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I reread all summaries, my little tool might get something wrong, and I did not detect it during the final read. If this happened or I missed any paper, please send me a DM on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markb_boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@markb_boss&lt;/a> or via mail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we go again!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="nerf">NeRF&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mildenhall &lt;em>et al.&lt;/em> introduced NeRF at ECCV 2020 in the now seminal &lt;a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Field paper&lt;/a>. As mentioned in the introduction, fantastic progress in research in this field has been made, and this is my third time covering it. CVPR 2023 is no exception, and NeRF finds applications in many new areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What NeRF does, in short, is similar to the task of computed tomography scans (CT). In CT scans, a rotating head measures densities from X-rays. However, knowing where that measurement should be placed in 3D is challenging. NeRF also tries to estimate where a surface and view-dependent radiance is located in space. This is done by storing the density and radiance in a neural volumetric scene representation using MLPs and then rendering the volume to create new images. With many posed images, photorealistic novel view synthesis is possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That was many papers, and compared to the previous &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVPR&lt;/a> (57 papers), the paper count has now grown to 175. CVPR 23 alone had more papers than NeurIPS, ECCV, and CVPR 2022 combined (140).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have the feeling my little ARCHIVE tool will come in handy this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from the sheer number of papers, there are prominent trends in the papers. To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, leveraging NeRFs for anything generative is a substantial new area, and it shows that NeRF and its extension are a mighty tool for this task. I also noticed many papers in the decomposition area - very close to my heart. This is great, and here also, NeRFs mainly play the role of a tool in the reconstruction process. There are also several papers in the SLAM field. So while Frank Dellaert originally termed it as the &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF Explosion&lt;/a>, we may now enter the time of the NeRFusion, where NeRF becomes a building block in many different areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially with the current speed of research and new trendy fields constantly emerging, it is exciting to see where NeRF will head next :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NeRF at ECCV 2022</title><link>https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_eccv22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 18:24:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_eccv22/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently went through the &lt;a href="https://eccv2022.ecva.net/program/provisional-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the provisional programm&lt;/a> of ECCV 2022. After my last &lt;a href="https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_neurips22/">post on &amp;ldquo;NeRF at NeurIPS&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> got such great feedback, and I anyway compiled a list of all NeRFy things, I decided to do it all again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I again tried to find all papers by parsing the titles of the provisional program. A brief scan through the paper or abstract was then done to confirm if it is NeRFy and get a rough idea about the paper. If I have mischaracterized or missed any paper, please send me a DM on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markb_boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@markb_boss&lt;/a> or via mail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we go again!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="nerf">NeRF&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mildenhall &lt;em>et al.&lt;/em> introduced NeRF at ECCV 2020 in the now seminal &lt;a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Field paper&lt;/a>. As mentioned in the introduction, there has been fantastic progress in research in this field. NeurIPS this year is no exception to this trend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What NeRF does, in short, is similar to the task of computed tomography scans (CT). In CT scans, a rotating head measures densities from x-rays. However, knowing where that measurement should be placed in 3D is challenging. NeRF also tries to estimate where a surface and view-dependent radiance is located in space. This is done by storing the density and radiance in a neural volumetric scene representation using MLPs and then rendering the volume to create new images. With many posed images, photorealistic novel view synthesis is possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>These papers address more fundamental problems of view-synthesis with NeRF methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically in streaming, the quality of the signal is adjusted depending on the connection quality. NeRFs, on the other hand, encode the entire signal in the weights. &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09663" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamable Neural Fields&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> aims to fix that by encoding everything into smaller sub-networks that can be streamed over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While NeRFs provide photorealistic novel view synthesis results, they do not offer a way to estimate the certainty of their reconstruction. Especially in medical or autonomous driving, this is a highly desirable property. &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conditional-Flow NeRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> aims to alleviate this by leveraging a flexible data-driven approach with conditional normalizing flows coupled with latent variable modeling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Estimating the pose of objects or the camera is a fundamental problem in computer vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Correspondence Field for Object Pose Estimation&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> estimates the pose of an object with a known 3D model by constructing neural correspondence fields, which create a 3D mapping between query points and the object space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RayTran&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> estimates the pose of objects and the shape from RGB videos. Here, a global 3D grid of features and an array of view-specific 2D grids is used. A progressive exchange of information is performed with a bidirectional attention mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GARF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> proposes to leverage Gaussian activation functions for pose estimation.

&lt;p>In this section, the radiance of NeRF is split into geometry, BRDF, and illumination. This enables consistent relighting under any illumination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF-OSR&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> enables relighting of outdoor scenes by decomposing the radiance to an albedo, Spherical Harmonics (SH) illumination model and explicitly modeling the shadowing from the SH illumination.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several works with excellent results in various fields.&lt;/p>

The method enables learning high-frequency content with a Local Texture Estimator instead of the classical NeRF Fourier embedding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Periodic patterns appear in many man-made scenes. NeRF-style methods do not capture these periodic patterns. &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPP&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> introduces a periodicity-aware warping module in front of the neural field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Implicit Neural Representations for Image Compression&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> investigates using neural fields for image compression tasks by introducing quantization, quantization-aware retraining, and entropy coding to neural fields. Meta-learned initializations from MAML also enable shorter training times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Strands&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> focuses on hair representation based on a neural scalp texture that encodes the geometry and appearance of individual strands at each texel location.

For this, the shadow map generated from a neural field that learns the depth map and a light position is compared to the actual captured one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaTeRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is a method for extracting an object from a neural field given a natural language description of the object and a set of point-labels of object and non-object points in the input images.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is my second time doing a conference roundup, and the number of papers is quite stunning. This time I gathered 50 papers from just a single conference. &lt;a href="https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_neurips22/">NeurIPS&lt;/a> had 36. If we also take &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVPR&lt;/a> into account (57 papers), the 3 conferences alone this year produced over 140 NeRF-related papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several trends in this year&amp;rsquo;s ECCV. One major one is combining transformers with NeRFs and, in general, adding neural priors. This trend was also visible in my &lt;a href="https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_neurips22/">NeurIPS roundup&lt;/a>. Another large one is examining NeRF and finding ways to express high-frequency data more easily or capture vast scenes. In my opinion, it is also amazing to see several works which decompose into BRDF, shape, and illumination or to see techniques such as shadow mapping being used in NeRFs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NeRF at NeurIPS 2022</title><link>https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_neurips22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 22:31:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://markboss.me/post/nerf_at_neurips22/</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Dellaert&lt;/a> and his excellent series on the original &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF Explosion&lt;/a> and the following &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICCV&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVPR&lt;/a> conference gatherings, I decided to look into creating a NeurIPS 22 rundown myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The papers below are all the papers I could gather by browsing through the extensive list of &lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?type=Poster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepted NeurIPS papers&lt;/a>.

If I have mischaracterized or missed any paper, please send me a DM on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markb_boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@markb_boss&lt;/a> or via mail.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="nerf">NeRF&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mildenhall &lt;em>et al.&lt;/em> introduced NeRF at ECCV 2020 in the now seminal &lt;a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Field paper&lt;/a>. As mentioned in the introduction, there has been fantastic progress in research in this field. NeurIPS this year is no exception to this trend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What NeRF does, in short, is similar to the task of computed tomography scans (CT). In CT scans, a rotating head measures densities from x-rays. However, knowing where that measurement should be placed in 3D is challenging. NeRF also tries to estimate where a surface and view-dependent radiance is located in space. This is done by storing the density and radiance in a neural volumetric scene representation using MLPs and then rendering the volume to create new images. With many posed images, photorealistic novel view synthesis is possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=52805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoENerf&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> introduces a Levels-of-Experts (LoE) framework to create a novel coordinate-based representation with an MLP. The weights of the MLP are hierarchical, periodic, and position-dependent.

Overview of &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuForm&lt;/a> which combines generalizable priors with the overfitting of typical NeRF model adaptively.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Priors can either aid in the reconstruction or can be used in a generative manner. For example, in the reconstruction, priors either increase the quality of neural view synthesis or enable reconstructions from sparse image collections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=55117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoCo-INR&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, two attention modules are used. One to extract useful information from the prior codebook and the other to encode these entries into the scene. With this prior, the method is capable of working on sparse images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In sparse image collections, several areas are often rarely observed. To circumvent this issue, &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuForm&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> relies on generalizable category-specific representation in less observed areas. In well-observed areas, the method uses the accurate overfitting of NeRF.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capturing dynamic objects is a trend that started in previous conference years. However, this year I noticed a trend in adding priors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=54986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Shape Deformation Priors&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> uses a transformer trained on large datasets to learn a prior of non-rigid transformations. A source mesh can be morphed with a continuous neural deformation field to a target mesh with a partially described surface deformation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeMF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> learns a prior of human and quadruped motion and uses it generatively in a neural motion field. The authors show use cases for motion interpolation or in-betweening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeVRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> proposes to use 3D spatial voxel grids alongside a 4D deformation field to model dynamic scenes in a highly efficient manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=54805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FNeVR&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> enables animating faces with NeRFs by combining 2D motion warping with neural rendering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDR&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> jointly optimizes the surface and deformation from a dynamic scene using monocular RGB-D cameras. They propose an invertible deformation network to provide cycle consistency between frames. As the topology might change in dynamic scenes, they also employ a strategy to generate topology variants.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCNeRF&lt;/a> enables compression and composition of NeRFs.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This section covers NeRFs that provide methods for composing, controlling, or editing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15838v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>NeRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> learns a decoupling of static and dynamic objects from monocular video. Here, two networks are trained separately, which handle the respective areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://ylqiao.net/publication/2022nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuPhysics&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> allows editing a dynamic scene by editing physics parameters. This editing is performed on a hexahedra mesh tied to an underlying neural field in a two-way conversion. The physics simulation is done differently on the mesh and can propagate back to the neural field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=54786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CageNeRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> uses low-poly cages around the object to create a simple deformation target. Deforming the cage is then simple in manual editing. The deformation can then be used to warp the previously trained NeRF.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=55279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INSP-Net&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> introduces signal processing into neural fields by introducing a differential operator framework, which can directly work on the fields without discretization. The authors even propose a CovnNet running on the neural representation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decomposing NeRF for Editing via Feature Field Distillation&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> uses existing 2D feature extractors such as CLIP-LSeg to provide additional supervision to detect semantics in the 3D volume. Users can query based on text, image patches, or direct pixel selection to allow semantic editing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCNeRF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> uses a tensor rank decomposition to express the neural fields in a highly efficient and compressible manner.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this section, the radiance of NeRF is split into geometry, BRDF, and illumination. This enables consistent relighting under any illumination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RENI&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> uses &lt;a href="https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/siren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIREN&lt;/a> and vector neurons to learn a neural prior on natural HDR illuminations. They extend the vector neurons to handle rotation equivariance for spherical images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/neuralps3d/neuralps3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Reflectance Field from Shading and Shadow under a Fixed Viewpoint&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> leverages a fixed viewpoint with a moving light source. This way, the geometry, and BRDF have to be recovered based on shading cues. Due to the neural fields, the 3D scene is recovered even from the fixed viewpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shape, Light &amp;amp; Material Decomposition from Images using Monte Carlo Rendering and Denoising&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> no previously used low-frequency basis or pre-integration is used to express the environment illumination. Instead, regular Monte Carlo integration is used, which is passed through a denoising network to ease the learning process from noisy gradients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAMURAI&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> the model can decompose coarsely posed image collections into shape, BRDF, and illumination. The cameras are also optimized during training with a camera multiplex. Especially, datasets of challenging scenes where traditional SFM methods fail can be decomposed with this method. &lt;em>For transparency, I&amp;rsquo;m the author of the paper&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several works with excellent results in various fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=55004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeMF&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> proposes to leverage neural fields for semantic correspondence matching. A coarse cost volume is used to guide a high-precision neural matching field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SNAKE&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> proposes introducing shape reconstruction with neural fields to aid in 3D keypoint detection for point clouds. No supervision for the detection is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Segmentation and concept learning in NeRFs can benefit from &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D Concept Grounding on Neural Fields&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, where a high-dimensional feature descriptor at each spatial location is taken from language embeddings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/Schedule?showEvent=53336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ULNef&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> specifically targets virtual try-on settings where multiple garments are layered. These layers are modeled as neural fields, and the collision handling is directly performed on the fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01634" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF-RL&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, a neural field is used to learn a latent space as the state representation for the reinforcement learning algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeRFception&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> establishes new large-scale datasets for perception-related tasks such as segmentation, classification, etc. They also evaluate a plenoxels variant on these datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was quite the amount of work, and I have enormous respect for Frank Dellaert for having it done thrice before. The field of NeRF moves incredibly fast, and even for a single conference, there exists a massive amount of reading material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also interesting to see NeRF find new applications in other fields such as &lt;a href="#audio">audio&lt;/a> and that sorting papers into a single category becomes challenging. This might be related to fast progress in the field and the high risk of getting scooped.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
