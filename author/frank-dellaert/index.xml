This time it is the big one: CVPR. The &lt;a href="https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/AcceptedPapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of accepted papers&lt;/a> is massive again, with 2359 papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is even more astounding is that the number of NeRF papers has grown significantly. I scanned the provisional program for potential NeRF titles and manually confirmed a relationship to the NeRF field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, writing a summary is an entirely different task. Frank Dellaert contacted me on Twitter about the CVPR post this year, and he gave me an idea to automate the entire summary using an LLM and creating slides for the posts. He even provided me access to his tools, research database, and a ChatGPT API key. Thank you so much - the idea worked wonders :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I built a small program: ARCHIVE: Ai assisted Research Conference Human-readable Instant surVEy. It automatically creates a summary (thanks, OpenAI ðŸ˜…) and formats the blog posts below. As the blog post is rather long, I also extended the tool to auto-generate a &lt;a href="https://markboss.me/archive_presentations/cvpr23/">slide deck&lt;/a> which also showcases prominent figures from the papers (automatically extracted). The ESC key displays a slide overview and you can use the arrow keys to move through the presentation (Categories left/right, individual slides up/down). The slide title is also a link to the paper itself. The entire deck is automatically generated by the tool (including extracting images and figure descriptions).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am extending the tool to provide other use cases, but this will be left for another blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I reread all summaries, my little tool might get something wrong, and I did not detect it during the final read. If this happened or I missed any paper, please send me a DM on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markb_boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@markb_boss&lt;/a> or via mail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we go again!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="nerf">NeRF&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mildenhall &lt;em>et al.&lt;/em> introduced NeRF at ECCV 2020 in the now seminal &lt;a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Field paper&lt;/a>. As mentioned in the introduction, fantastic progress in research in this field has been made, and this is my third time covering it. CVPR 2023 is no exception, and NeRF finds applications in many new areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What NeRF does, in short, is similar to the task of computed tomography scans (CT). In CT scans, a rotating head measures densities from X-rays. However, knowing where that measurement should be placed in 3D is challenging. NeRF also tries to estimate where a surface and view-dependent radiance is located in space. This is done by storing the density and radiance in a neural volumetric scene representation using MLPs and then rendering the volume to create new images. With many posed images, photorealistic novel view synthesis is possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That was many papers, and compared to the previous &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVPR&lt;/a> (57 papers), the paper count has now grown to 175. CVPR 23 alone had more papers than NeurIPS, ECCV, and CVPR 2022 combined (140).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have the feeling my little ARCHIVE tool will come in handy this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from the sheer number of papers, there are prominent trends in the papers. To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, leveraging NeRFs for anything generative is a substantial new area, and it shows that NeRF and its extension are a mighty tool for this task. I also noticed many papers in the decomposition area - very close to my heart. This is great, and here also, NeRFs mainly play the role of a tool in the reconstruction process. There are also several papers in the SLAM field. So while Frank Dellaert originally termed it as the &lt;a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF Explosion&lt;/a>, we may now enter the time of the NeRFusion, where NeRF becomes a building block in many different areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially with the current speed of research and new trendy fields constantly emerging, it is exciting to see where NeRF will head next :).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
