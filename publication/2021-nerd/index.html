The object can be rotated, or the camera can turn around the object. The result is a neural volume with an explicit representation of the appearance and illumination in the form of the BRDF and Spherical Gaussian (SG) environment illumination.</p><p>The method is based on the general structure of <a href=https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf target=_blank rel=noopener>NeRF</a>. However, NeRF encodes the scene to an implicit BRDF representation where a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) is queried for outgoing view directions at every point. Extracting information from NeRF is therefore not easily done, and the inference time for novel views takes around 30 seconds. Also, NeRF is not capable of relighting an object under any illumination. By introducing physically-based representations for lighting and appearance, NeRD can relighting an object, and information can be extracted from the neural volume. After our extraction process, the result is a regular texture mesh that can be rendered in real-time. See our <a href=#results>results</a> where we provide a web-based interactive renderer.</p><h3 id=method>Method</h3><p>Decomposing the scene requires that the integral over the hemisphere from the rendering equation is decomposed into its parts. Here, we use a simplified version without self-emittance.
$$L_o(x,\omega_o) = \int_\Omega L_i(x,\omega_i) f_r(x,\omega_i,\omega_o) (\omega_i \cdot n) d\omega_i$$
Here, $L_o$ is the outgoing radiance for a point $x$ in the direction $\omega_o$. This radiance is calculated by integrating all influences over the hemisphere $\Omega$, which are based on the incoming light $L_i$ for each direction $\omega_i$. The surface behavior is expressed as the BRDF $f_r$, which describes how incoming light $\omega_i$ is directed to the outgoing direction $\omega_o$. Lastly, a cosine term is used $(\omega_i \cdot n)$, which reduces the received light based on the angle towards the light source.</p><p>The inverse of this integral is highly ambiguous, and we use several approximations to solve it. We do not use any interreflections or shadowing, which means that we do not compute the incoming radiance recursively. Additionally, our illumination is expressed as SG, which reduces a full continuous integral to - in our case - 24 evaluation of the environment SGs.</p><figure id=figure-steps-of-the-query-process-in-a-the-volume-is-constructed-by-tracing-rays-from-each-camera-into-the-scene-then-samples-are-placed-along-with-the-rays-in-b-and-based-on-the-density-at-each-sampling-point-additional-samples-are-placed-in-c-the-samples-are-then-evaluated-into-a-brdf-which-is-re-rendered-using-the-jointly-optimized-illumination-in-d><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=w-100><img alt="Steps of the query process.
